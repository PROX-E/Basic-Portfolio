        <p>
            My name is Hunter August Shriver, I am 21 Years old from St. Paul Mn. 
            Music is my first love, followed by an almost equally strong passion for good coffee.
            I was first introduced to HTML when I was 14, but never really pursued development until 
            after I graduated High School.
